# 🐳 Configuring a Macvlan Management Network for cEOS Lab

This guide explains how to create a **macvlan** Docker network (e.g., `a-135`) tied to a specific host interface and use it as the management network in your cEOS lab.

---

## 📋 Why?

The cEOS lab script assumes an existing external management network (default: `a-135`).  
If you want to use a **macvlan** network instead — for example to put containers directly on your physical LAN — you need to create it first.

## MacVlan creation using script

### 📝 Workflow

✅ During execution of **python3 generate-lab.py topology.yml**, the script:  
> 1️⃣ Checks for any existing macvlan Docker network.  
> 2️⃣ If none are found, prompts you and walks you through creating one.  
> 3️⃣ If macvlan networks are found, lists them and lets you pick one.  
> 4️⃣ If you select or create a network other than a-135, the script automatically updates your topology.yml with the chosen network name and informs you.  
> 5️⃣ The script then proceeds to generate the final docker-compose.yml file.

## 🟦 🐳 Optional: Manual MacVlan Network Creation

### Check if you currently have any macvlan docker network and if the network currently associated with an interface

From the bash of the host run following commands:

```bash
docker network ls
```

Your output might be different, here is an example:
```
NETWORK ID     NAME        DRIVER    SCOPE
3e5cf2...      bridge      bridge    local
b7e34a...      host        host      local
e4b5e7...      none        null      local
1d4e5b...      a-135       macvlan   local
9c6f1a...      a-150       bridge    local
```

👉 If you don’t see any macvlan network listed, proceed to the 🔷 [Step-by-Step](#step-by-step) section below to create one.


### Check macvlan network association with host interface

Run this command to inspect the network:


```bash
docker network inspect a-135
```

You should see an output like this:

```
[
    {
        "Name": "a-135",
        "Id": "1d4e5b...",
        "Driver": "macvlan",
        "Scope": "local",
        "IPAM": {
            "Config": [
                {
                    "Subnet": "10.240.135.0/24",
                    "Gateway": "10.240.135.1"
                }
            ]
        },
        "Options": {
            "parent": "ens192" // 👈 host interface used
        }
    }
]

```

Here, "parent": "ens192" shows which host interface the macvlan is bound to.

---

## 🔷 Step-by-Step

### 1️⃣ Create a macvlan network

If you prefer to create a macvlan network manually (instead of letting the script handle it), run this command:

```bash
docker network create -d macvlan \
  --subnet=10.240.135.0/24 \
  --gateway=10.240.135.1 \
  -o parent=ens192 \
  a-135
```

Replace:

- 10.240.135.0/24 → with your desired subnet
- 10.240.135.1 → with your desired gateway
- ens192 → with your host interface
- a-135 → with your desired network name

#### 📌 Notes

- You can create the macvlan ahead of time and let the script detect it.
- Or you can simply let the script create it interactively when needed.
- Either way, the script will update your topology.yml accordingly.
